Ingredients


1 (10 ounce) strip steak

salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste

3 tablespoons unsalted butter

1 small shallot, finely diced

2 cloves garlic, minced

6 ounces fettuccine noodles

5 ounces garlic and herb cream cheese

1/4 cup whipping cream

1 tablespoon lemon juice

1 tablespoon minced fresh parsley

Directions

step1
Let steak rest at room temperature for 15 to 20 minutes. Pat steak dry with paper towels. Season with salt and pepper on both sides.
step2
Heat a cast-iron skillet over high heat until very hot. Add butter, and immediately reduce heat to medium-low.
step3
Sear steak for 3 to 4 minutes per side for medium-rare [135 degrees F (57 degrees C) internal temperature]. During the last minute of cooking, add shallot and garlic to the pan. Tilt the pan and spoon the melted butter and shallot mixture over the steak repeatedly.
step4
Remove the steak to a cutting board; do not wipe out the skillet. Tent steak loosely with foil, and let rest for 5 to 7 minutes.
step5
Meanwhile, bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add fettuccine and cook until tender with a bite, 8 to 10 minutes. Reserve 1/2 cup pasta water, drain the pasta, and set aside.
step6
In the same cast iron skillet over medium heat, whisk in cream cheese and heavy cream until smooth. Gradually add reserved pasta water, starting with 1/4 cup and adding more as needed to achieve a creamy, pourable consistency. Stir in lemon juice, taste, and adjust seasoning with salt and pepper.
step7
Add cooked fettuccine to the sauce, tossing to coat evenly. If the sauce thickens too much, add more pasta water to loosen it.
step8
Divide the cooked fettuccine between 2 plates. Sliced steak across the grain and place on top of pasta. Sprinkle with minced parsley; season with salt and pepper.
